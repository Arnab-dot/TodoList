# 📝 ToDo List App (React.js)

A simple and interactive **ToDo List Application** built using **React.js**. This is my first project in React where I practiced component-based architecture, state management using hooks, and clean UI design.

## 🚀 Features

- Add new tasks easily
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Responsive and clean user interface
- Smooth transitions and interactivity

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- ⚛️ React.js (with functional components)
- 🎨 CSS3 (custom styling with transitions and hover effects)
- 🗂️ JSX for templating
- 💡 useState hook for state management
